# Colors-of-Life
A recreation of conways game of life with extra cell types

## How To play
Once you run the game you will have a selection of cells to chose from which you can place and destory on click you can press space to pause the game
and you will have to rerun the program to reset the map
### Editing Game Settings
Enter the "config.txt" file once inside you should see

```
CellSize:10
MapWidth:100
MapHeight:100
```
Cellsize is just the size of each cell if your map becomes too big you can lower this value, making the whole if not most of the map visible 
Edit these values however you want but note if your map is to large it can cause long loading and lag.
